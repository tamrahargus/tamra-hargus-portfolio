Welcome to my GitHub. After 20+ years designing chips at Intel and working across SOC and analog layout, I’m using this space to share what I know, what I’m learning, and where I’m going next. Whether you’re here to look at my notes, connect over a project, or just curious about my journey—thanks for stopping by.
